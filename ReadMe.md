# Graph-based metamodeling (GraphMM) to uncover cell dynamics and function across molecular, cellular, and multicellular scales

This is the official repository for GraphMM, a Python package to uncover cell dynamics and function across molecular, cellular, and multicellular scales.

# Introduction

We introduce Graph-based Metamodeling (GraphMM), a novel framework that integrates models across multiple representations and spatiotemporal scales, by (i) converting input models into universal surrogate representations using probabilistic graphical models; (ii) coupling surrogates across time scales using a standardized strategy; and (iii) approximate metamodel inference. Validation through synthetic benchmarks and real-world applications shows improved accuracy over existing methods. GraphMM enables quantitative predictions of $\beta$-cell dynamics and function across molecular, cellular, and multicellular scales. GraphMM provides a versatile framework for integrating models to uncover the dynamics of complex systems.

# Repo Structure

The project contains a benchmark and a multi-scale insulin secretion metamodel (MuSIS), both using the GraphMM modeling framework. The project structure is as follows:
1. `Benchmark/`: Contains the benchmark toy system for GraphMM using a toy GSIS model.  
**Quick start**: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K5eKwQ1fXwWwJiVSIqbV4sTWd_qw-4GL/)
   

2. `GraphMM_MuSIS/`: The main package for GraphMM
     - `InputModel/`:
        - Contains subsystem models 
    - `GraphMetamodel/`:
        - Defines connections between surrogate models
        - Implements multi-scale inference
    - `results/`:
        - Stores output files from model simulations   



# Usage

### Prerequisite

```bash
python           3.7
scikit-learn     1.0.2
pandas           1.3.5
numpy            1.21.6
scipy            1.7.3
filterpy         1.4.5
daft             2.10.0
```

### Benchmark - Toy GSIS metamodel
To run the metamodel enumeration:
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
2. Run `enumerate_metamodel.py`
3. Results will be saved in the `results/enumerate_metamodel_v2/` directory
4. Visualizations can be generated using the plotting functions in the script

```bash
cd Benchmark
python Surrogate_model_a.py
python Surrogate_model_b.py
```

### Multi-scale insulin secretion metamodel (MuSIS)
To run the MuSIS metamodel:
1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed
2. Run `metamodel_inference.py`
3. Results will be saved in the `results/metamodel_inference/` directory
4. Visualizations can be generated using the plotting functions in the script

```bash
cd GraphMM_MuSIS
python run_surrogate_ISK_active.py
python run_surrogate_IHC_active.py
python run_surrogate_VE_active.py
python run_musis_metamodel_active.py
```
